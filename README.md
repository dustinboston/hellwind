# Hellwind: A Tailwind Parody in One Act

Why spend time memorizing a bunch of cryptic Tailwind abbreviations when you can write media queries, pseudo classes, and css properties that you already know?

Hellwind makes this easy. Start with the target media query (or leave it off for the default). Next, add any of the link pseudo classes like hover.
Then follow it with the property name and its value. Easy.

```html
<a class="media-min-width-1280px--hover--background-color-dogerblue">
    Victory!
</a>
```

And you don't need to install 27 gigs of JavaScript dependencies and a plugin to make your IDE understand it. That's because it's PURE CSS.
All you have to do is download the 18 MB CSS file and stick it in your project. Works in any browser.

Docs coming soon. This is a joke, even though it actually works.
